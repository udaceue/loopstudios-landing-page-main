## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JS (just for responsive navbar)

### What I learned

- CSS Grid.
- Responsive Navbar.
- Css @supports, logical properties like: "margin-inline", "inset".
- Css backdrop filter property.
- Data attribute.


### Continued development

Next time I'm gonna do project with in React/Typescript and some styling library where I will be able to use my new Css skills


### Useful resources

- [CSS Grid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rg7Fvvl3taU) - This helped me to include powerfull grid tool to my flexbox set. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Example resource 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbBMp6yUXO0) - This is an amazing video which helped me finally understand responsive navbars. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
